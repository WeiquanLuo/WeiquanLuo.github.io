5+ years of research experience in building complete data pipeline and applying statistical techniques and machine learning models to solve real-world problems. 

I develop innovative and practical solutions to complex problems without direct technical supervision. 

I am fascinated with Statistics. My goal is to become a *Data Scientist*.

**Milestone (Mar 8/2023): Now I understand why graduate-level statistics start from mean model. **

The entire statistics world intend to answer one question: ***is there a difference between groups?***

Different statistical measure, (so-called **statistics**) lead to different method (so-called **hypothesis testing**) and standardized measure (so-called **effect size**)
By including co-variate, **regression analysis** by grouping (so-call **random intercept**) comes in. 
When variance is not uniform along the line (so-called violating **homoscedasticity assumption**), then **generalized linear regression** comes in. 
When the grouping has nested structure (usually cause by **experiment design**), interaction of the grouping and slope may exist (so-called **random slope**), then **hierarchical Linear Regression** and **meta-analysis** comes in.


So the reason why starting from mean model is that the regression is such an ***elegant framework*** for statistical communication from the most bottom to top method. However, people won't understand why all are in regression language unless perceiving the initial intention of statistics.
