I am a graduate student at [Iowa State University](https://www.abe.iastate.edu), pursuing an MS in Agriculture Biosystem Engineering. I am currently working with [Dr. Amy Kaleita-forbes](https://www.abe.iastate.edu/amy-kaleita) and [Dr. Adina Howe](https://www.abe.iastate.edu/adina-howe) on research in FEW analysis using Bayesian networks. I am also interested in empirical analysis to engineering problem. Contact me at weiquanl@iastate.edu or find my latest projects on GitHub.
